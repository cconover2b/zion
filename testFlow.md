** **I need to add each username as a collaborator under Settings and Collaborators ****

## **Cloning**

```python
git clone https://github.com/cconover2b/zion.git
```

```python
cd zion
```

## **Add and Commit to Git**

- Add a line to the [README.md](http://README.md) just for testing

```python
git add README.md
```

git commit -m "Added a line"

### If you get an auth error like this:

```python
Author identity unknown

** Please tell me who you are.

Run

git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.

Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got 'growthemp@GrowthPC2.(none)')
```

Here is what to do:

```python
git config --global user.email "youremail@gmail.com"
```

```python
git config --global user.name "Craig Conover"
```

Now continue with the commit

```python
git commit -m "Added a line of code."
```

- I had to login with my browser and then it worked perfectly.

## **To remove as file from cached on Git**

- if you have added a file or committed a file, to get it from being tracked so you can add it to another branch or something like that.

```python
git rm --cached <file>

# Here is my Example:

git rm --cached test2.py
```

## **Add a New Branch and Add, Commit, and Push**

- Add a branch

```python
git branch craig
```

- Switch to that branch

```python
git checkout craig
```

- Now Add files

```python
git add test.py
```

```python
git commit -m "Added a test file"
```

- For your first push on a new branch, you must add an upstream

```python
git push -u https://github.com/cconover2b/zion.git
```

- After you have pushed once you can just use git push going forward

```python
git push
```
